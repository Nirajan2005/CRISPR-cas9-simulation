# CRISPR Simulator 

A simple gene editing simulation using CRISPR-Cas9 logic in Python. Built by [Nirajan Kunwar](https://github.com/yourusername) to simulate gene editing with PAM recognition and strand-specific edits.

##  Features
- Detects PAM sequences (default: NGG)
- Simulates deletions, insertions, substitutions
- Handles forward and reverse strand edits
- Allows random or custom insert/substitute sequences
- Supports batch editing with max limit

##  How to Use

1. Clone the repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/crispr-simulator.git
cd crispr-simulator
